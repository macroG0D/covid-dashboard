# Covid-19 Dashboard
## deploy: https://macrog0d.github.io/production/covid-dashboard/

Covid-19 is probably the most loud subject of 2020. Within this project I've implemented a detailed dashboard which can show correct epidemic statistics for almost all countries. The app has very interactive map, graphs, and many types of stats information like total cases, total recovered and so on for each country.
